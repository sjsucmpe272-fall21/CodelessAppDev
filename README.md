# Team-Project-18 -> Project Proposal

**Project Idea 1.**
**Codeless Application Development**
----------------------

Introduction to the problem statement:
--------------------
In a world where Industry is moving towards Agile model, rapid development and delivery of working software products is a huge challenge.
Codeless Application Development platform intends to reduce the gap between requirements and the deliverable product by using 
Natural Language processing and Deep Learning.

Abstract (Rough draft): 
----------------------------
Codeless Application Development platform takes in user requirements in Well-formed English Language sentences 
and can generate the code for required functionality in required programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java and SQL etc. 
This platform then also provides an option to push that function/code generated by NLP onto a repository, 
which is linked to a containerized CI/CD pipeline that can create/update an application instance on the cloud that’s deliverable instantly.
The user has an option to either push the code or just verify that the code generated by the platform is in sync 
with their requirements which were input to the system. The platform also can support tasks such as 
generating English text which explains the given input program/function code.

Approach
----------
The platform uses OpenAI’s GPT-3 API under the hood to take in Requirements in simple English sentences and to generate logical and accurate code. 
Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. 
GPT-3's deep learning neural network is a model with over 175 billion machine learning parameters.

This platform intends to use the excellent text generation capabilities of GPT-3 to generate codes in different programming languages
by passing requirements as prompt to the API call. Once the response is generated, the platform would be able to display the code to a user,
save the particular requirement and response in the user’s Code generation history and will give the user an option to push the code
to repositories such as GitHub. The platform will be able to link and authenticate user’s GitHub profile securely to enable pushing code. 
We can either choose to write our own build files for CI/CD pipelines or try to generate them from the platform’s code generator.
Codeless Application Development platform enables code generation from requirements, renders it to the user to verify 
and provides options to push the code into containerized pipelines to turn it into a deliverable piece of software.

Persona
----------

	-Businesses, Companies, Developers on the lookout for Rapid Development and Deliverables.
	-Non-Techies who want to build things without deep diving into the tech infrastructure.
	-Students who want to understand the flow of Agile Development
